title: Classical cadence types

A _cadence_ is a point of arrival that punctuates the end of a musical unit, such as a phrase, theme, large formal section, or movement. A cadence is at once a harmonic, melodic, rhythmic, and formal event, but cadences tend to be grouped according to different ways in which harmony and melody articulate that point of arrival.

## Authentic and half cadences

These unit-ending points of arrival are first grouped into _authentic cadences_ and _half cadences_. An authentic cadence occurs when a formal unit ends with the progression **D5–T1** (**V<sup>(7)</sup>–I**, _sol_ to _do_ in the bass voice). If the melody accompanying this harmonic progression arrives on _do_, it is called a _perfect authentic cadence_; it the melody ends on _mi_ or _me_ (or more rarely _sol_), it is called an _imperfect authentic cadence_.

Phrases that end on **V** without progressing to **I** are called _half cadences_. These cadences typically contain _re_ in the melody, though _ti_ and _sol_ are also possible points of melodic arrival. The **V** is almost invariably a triad, rather than a seventh chord, and it is always in root position (**D5**).

Differentiating between _perfect authentic cadences_ (PAC), _imperfect authentic cadences_ (IAC), and _half cadences_ (HC) by ear and with a score is essential both to formal analysis and model composition.

## Simple, compound, and double cadences

Writers of Italian keyboard treatises like [Furno][furno] and [Fenaroli][fenaroli] (and, more recently, American historical theorists like [Robert O. Gjerdingen][gjerdingen]) differentiate cadences according to the voice-leading found over the dominant harmony. These distinctions do not replace the above PAC/IAC/HC distinctions; rather they add another level of detail that is particularly helpful in model composition. These voice-leading distinctions provide three more cadence categories to complement PAC, IAC, and HC: the _simple cadence_, the _compound cadence_, and the _double cadence_.

A _simple cadence_ occurs when the dominant harmonic function is articulated by a single chord—either a triad or a seventh chord. The simple cadence can be used in a PAC, IAC, or HC construction, though the seventh-chord version is typically only found in authentic cadences.

A _compound cadence_ occurs when the bass note _sol_ of the cadential dominant is repeated, often with the second _sol_ an octave lower than the first. The compound cadence comes in three specific forms.

The first type of compound cadence involves a 4–3 suspension—_do_ to _ti_—over the _sol_ bass of the dominant harmony. In a four-voice texture, the other two voices sustain a fifth above the bass and an octave above the bass. The _thoroughbass_ figure is typically the abbreviated 4–3, which stands for 8/5/4–8/5/3 in four voices. The 4–3 suspension can occur over the cadential dominant of a PAC, IAC, or HC.

The second type of compound cadence adds a _mi/me_ to _re_ voice (6–5) to the above 4–3 suspension. In a four-voice texture, the bass is doubled. The typical thoroughbass figure is 6/4–5/3, leading to the common name for this progression, the _cadential six-four_. The complete figure is 8/6/4–8/5/3. The cadential six-four can occur over the cadential dominant of a PAC, IAC, or HC.

The last type of compound cadence is a special case of the cadential six-four, where the fourth voice introduces a seventh over the second dominant chord, rather than simply doubling the bass for both chords. This compound cadence type requires four voices and complete thoroughbass figures of 8/6/4–7/5/3. This figure rarely occurs over the dominant of a half cadence and is instead reserved primarily for authentic cadences.

A _double cadence_ is a four-stage pattern over the cadential dominant used almost exclusively in perfect authentic cadences. Though it had expired from common use by the time of Mozart and Haydn, it was a staple for earlier _galant_ composers and _Classical_ treatises on composition and accompaniment. The four-stage pattern over the dominant is 5/3–6/4–5/4–5/3. In four voices, the bass is also doubled, or a seventh can be applied to any _chord of the fifth_ (i.e., not the 6/4).

## Voice-leading in strict keyboard style

In strict melodic keyboard style, always end an idealized phrase with a perfect authentic cadence (PAC). Approach the melody's final _do_ by step whenever possible, from _re_ or _ti_, preferably from _re_. When using compound or double cadences, use the orientation of upper voices shown in the above figures (transposed to the appropriate key, of course).

In _basso continuo_ style, the top voice can end with any member of the tonic triad. As much as possible, use the voices provided in the figures above, but invert them (move the tenor line to the top, making the melody and alto the alto and tenor, for example). Simply make sure that if _ti_ occurs in the top voice before the final tonic chord, it resolves its tendency up to _do_.

In either case, pay special attention to the cadential six-four version of the compound cadence. Despite forming a consonant triad with the bass, both the sixth and the fourth of the first chord act like suspensions, and therefore _must resolve down by step_ and be prepared smoothly (by common tones or steps). This is true no matter which part is in the melody, alto, or tenor.
