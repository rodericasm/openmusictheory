title: Scales and scale degrees
---

A scale is a succession of pitches ascending or descending in steps. There are two types of steps: _half steps_ and _whole steps_. A half step (H) consists of two adjacent pitches on the keyboard. A whole step (W) consists of two half steps. Usually, the pitches in a scale are each notated with different letter names, though this isn't always possible or desirable.

### The Chromatic Scale

The chromatic scale consists entirely of half steps, and uses every pitch on the keyboard within a single octave. Here is the chromatic scale that spans the pitches C4 through C5.

### The major scale

A major scale, a sound with which you are undoubtedly familiar, consists of seven whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W-W-H-W-W-W-H. The first pitch of the scale, called the _tonic_, is the pitch upon which the rest of the scale is based. When the scale ascends, the tonic is repeated at the end an octave higher.

Here is the D major scale. It is called the "D major scale" because the pitch D is the _tonic_ and is heard at both ends of the scale.

### Scale degrees and solfège

While ISO notation allows us to label a pitch in its specific register, it is often useful to know where that pitch fits within a given scale. For example, the pitch class D is the first (and last) note of the D-major scale. The pitch class A is the fifth note of the D-major scale. When described in this way, we call the notes _scale degrees_, because they're placed in context of a specific scale. Solfège syllables, [a centuries-old method of teaching pitch and sight singing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solfège), can also be used to represent scale degrees (when used in this way, this system is specifically called movable-_do_ solfège).

Scale degrees are labeled with Arabic numerals and carets (^). The illustration below shows a D-major scale and corresponding ISO notation, scale degrees, and solfège syllables.

### The minor scale

Another scale with which you are likely very familiar is the minor scale. There are several scales that one might describe as _minor_, all of which have a characteristic third scale degree that is lower than the one found in the major scale. The minor scale most frequently used in tonal music from the Common Practice period is based on the _aeolian mode_ (you'll read more about modes later), which is sometimes referred to as the _natural minor_ scale.

The natural minor scale consists of seven whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W-H-W-W-H-W-W. Note the changes in solfège syllables.

If you sing through the above example, you'll notice that the ending lacks the same sense of closure you heard in the major scale. This closure is created in the major scale, in part, by the ascending semitone between _ti_ and _do_. Composers often want to have this sense of closure when using the minor mode, too. They're able to achieve this by applying an accidental to the seventh scale degree, raising it by a semitone. If you do this within the context of the natural minor scale, you get something called the _harmonic minor_ scale.

Now the last two notes of the scale sound much more conclusive, but you might have found it difficult to sing _le_ to _ti_. When writing melodies in a minor key, composers often "corrected" this by raising _le_ by a semitone to become _la_ when approaching the note _ti_. When the melody descended from _do_, the closure from _ti_ to _do_ isn't needed; likewise, it is no longer necessary to "correct" _le_, so the natural form of the minor scale is used again. Together, these different ascending and descending versions are called the _melodic minor_ scale.

When ascending, the _melodic minor_ scale uses _la_ and _ti_.

When descending, the _melodic minor_ scale uses the "natural" _te_ and _le_.

Truth be told, most composers don't really think about three different "forms" of the minor scale. The _harmonic minor_ scale simply represents composers' tendency to use _ti_ when building harmonies that include the seventh scale degree in the minor mode. Likewise, the _melodic minor_ scale is derived from composers' desire to avoid the melodic augmented second interval (more on this in the [intervals](intervals.html) section) between _le_ and _ti_ (and some chose not to avoid this!). In reality, there is only one "version" of the minor scale. Context determines when a composer might use _la_ and _ti_ when writing music in a minor key.
