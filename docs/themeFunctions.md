title: Thematic Function

This page is a quick-reference. For examples of these functions in musical contexts, see the resource on [Classical theme types](classicalThemes.html).

# Initiating Functions

## Presentation

_Presentation function_ comes at the _beginning_ of a theme or phrase. It involves the _establishment of the primary melodic material_ (usually through the use of one or more statements of a _basic idea_) and the _establishment of the tonality of the theme_ (usually through _tonic prolongation_).

## Antecedent

_Antecedent function_ comes at the _beginning_ of a theme or phrase. It involves the statement of a _basic idea_ followed by a _contrasting idea._ An _antecedent_ should close with a weak cadence, usually a HC or IAC.

# Medial Functions

## Continuation

_Continuation function_ comes in the _middle_ of a phrase or theme. It typically involves the _breakdown of the primary melodic material_ and _harmonic acceleration_ towards the cadence.

Following are important terms/concepts associated with continuation function. Not all need be present for a passage to express continuation function, but some should be.

- _Fragmentation_ – Breaking the melodic unit into smaller chunks (for example, following two-bar basic ideas in the presentation with one-bar melodic ideas). Note: fragmentation references the breakdown of the _size_ of the units. Those units are not necessarily related melodically.
- _Liquidation_ – Gradually replacing the _characteristic_ or unique parts of a melody with _conventional_ or common elements.
- _Sequential repetition_ – Repeating the same melodic or harmonic element two or three times, transposed to different pitch levels. This is often used in conjunction with fragmentation.
- _Acceleration of melodic rhythm_ – Changing from predominately quarter notes and eighth notes in the melody to predominately eighth notes and sixteenth notes, for example.
- _Acceleration of harmonic rhythm_ – Chord changes coming more frequently (changing from one chord per bar to two chords per bar, for example).

#Closing Functions

## Cadential

_Cadential function_ comes at the end of a theme or phrase. It typically involves a _cadential harmonic progression_ and a _conventional, descending melodic pattern_.

A classical cadential progression _begins with the last chord of tonic prolongation_ and _ends with a cadential arrival_. The [three typical types of cadential arrival](cadenceTypes.html) in Classical music are the perfect authentic cadence (PAC), the imperfect authentic cadence (IAC), and the half cadence (HC).

A half-cadential progression will begin with the final **T** chord, progress (optionally) through **S**, and arrive on a cadential **D** chord (_always_ **D5**: **V** or **V<sup>7</sup>**):

> **T** (S**) D5**

An authentic-cadential progression will begin with the final **T** chord, progress (optionally) through **S**, and end with the cadential **D T** progression (_always_ **D5 T1**: **V<sup>(7)</sup> I**):

> **T* (S*) D5 T1**

## Consequent

_Consequent function_ resembles _antecedent function_ in that it involves the presentation of a basic idea followed by a contrasting one. Unlike the _antecedent function_, however, _consequent function_ brings completion to a thematic unit. Therefore, it ends with a strong cadence, typically a PAC.

<!--

## General notes ##

Just as there is exactly one progression through **T (S) D T** for every cadence in classical music, there is exactly one progression through **presentation – continuation – cadential** functions for every cadence in classical music.

None of these functions are optional; all must be present in a normative formal progression.-->
