# Open Music Theory (reskinned) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rodericasm/openmusictheory_reskinned.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rodericasm/openmusictheory_reskinned)


This is a reskin of the [Open Music Theory](http://www.openmusictheory.com) textbook/website. This reskin follows the API/DOCS design.

> See the [demo](https://www.rodericasm.github.io/openmusictheory) here

This version is ported to Vuepress from Jekyll, with no revisions to the markdown content, except for image resizing and normalizing urls for Vuepress. (Of course, feel free to pull if anything was missed/not working as intended.)

This reskin follows the same open source, philosophy as the original did. (See the Creative Commons license deed linked on each page of the textbook.)

Thanks to those who have supported and developed this textbook. Check our the original/official textbook here. [openmusictheory.com](http://www.openmusictheory.com).
